In part 1 of this workshop, I learned about operator overloading. We have overloaded on most kinds of operators, including comparison operators, addition/subtraction operators, assignment operators, and conversion operator. I also learned about the convenience of modular programming - a lot of the functions shall be designed and written in a way that they are flexible and re-usable. I also practiced the usage of the this pointer, and returning by references instead of values. In addition, for operators that cannot be implemented as a public member function, we will have to implement them outside of the class, as a global function.
