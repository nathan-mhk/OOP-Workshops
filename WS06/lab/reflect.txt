In this workshop, I've learned about some simple file operations like 
reading from files and writing to files. I've also learned about 
using the `friend` keyword to grant access to another class. This 
could be useful when we want to encapsulate a higher-level operation 
and hide some lower-level implementations. Overall, I don't find this 
workshop to be too difficult.

In this project's milestone, I've once again had a revision on 
operators overloading, input validation, and some simple string 
operations. I've also learned how to make a input-handling function 
adheres to the istream standards - by setting the state of the input 
stream object instead of clearing or flushing the stream buffer. 
Overall, I found this workshop to be a bit more challenging than the 
workshop, as we do not have explicit instructions on exactly what 
lines of code we should write. Instead, we are given a higher-level 
overview/instructions on the functionality of each of the methods. 
And we have to think carefully while implementing the functions, in 
order to create a concise program.
