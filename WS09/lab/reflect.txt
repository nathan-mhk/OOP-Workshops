In this workshop, I've practiced on the idea of inheritance with dynamically 
allocated resources on both the base class and the derived class. There are 
some essential things that we have to be aware of when designing and 
implementing polymorphic classes:
1. Be sure to invoke the base class's functions beforehand.
2. Destructors should be declared as virtual.
3. The scope operator is essential to tell compiler which (base or derived) 
   function to invoke. 

Overall, this workshop is not too difficult.

In this project milestone, I've practices the usage of ABC. We have designed 
and implemented 2 concrete classes that are derived from the ABC that we have 
designed and implemented in the last milestone. This milestone teaches us the 
brief idea on the benefits and the usage of ABCs.

Overall, this milestone isn't too challenging. However, I do have to go back to 
my previous work to fix some minor bugs here and there.
